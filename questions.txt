1. All pages should be responsive
2. Add the feature to Schedule discounts for specific dates. Go to marketplace - click on "Create" button . There should be a sale end date field in the page that automatically reverts prices to the origianl price after the schedule discount period @app/(market)/product/create @app/(market)/product/edit 
3. Add product status filter : draft, published, archived. Go to marketplace - click on your avatar - click on "Account" - switch to "My products". Products created should have a status and we should be able to filter the products by status. @app/(market)/account 
4. On the User account, in the settings tab, the "Allow others to see my wishlist" tick box returns a 500 error page. Go to marketplace - click on your avatar - click on "Account" - switch to settings tab. The "Allow others to see my wishlist" tick box should allow youto share your wishlist. @app/(market)/account 
5.  Cannot add payout account. The detecting region field shows "detecting.." non stop. The Dropdown for bank and mobile money options do not dropdown any options.  Go to marketplace - click on your avatar - click on "Account" - switch to settings tab. I should be able to add my payout account seamlessly @app/(market)/account 
6. Create new tab in the account page for payouts. Design inspiration here @web https://dribbble.com/shots/23500284-Balance-and-Withdrawal . Like a dashboard for vendors/merchants to see analytics, payouts, transactions, etc. Nice UI. use just the design on the right hand side. Also take out the payout section from the "Settigns" tab. Go to marketplace - click on your avatar - click on "Account. New payouts tab in the user account page that allows you to connect your payout account and see a list of payout transcations.
7. No navbar on the user profile page. We can use the current navbar without the category filters. Go to marketplace - click on another vendor's/merchant's name in the product card . We need a nav bar that allows us to navigate back to the homepage and see our cart. @app/(market)/author 
8. The public user profile should not show how much revenue I am earning as a user. Go to marketplace - click on another vendor's name in the product card. The revenue card should be removed. @app/(market)/author 
9. No Coupon code page in the admin dashboard. There should be a way to create coupon cdes in the backend. @app/admin @app/models

12. The Content Length filter on the left hand side isn't connected to the products. Clicking on it doesn't filter out the products in the marketplace. Go to marketplace - click on the checkbox next to "Quick Read (< 30 min)". The Content Length filter should filter out products based on content length @filter-sidebar.js @filter-sidebar.js 
13. The search functionality is case sensitive. I searched "Write" with a small "w" but I got a "no results" feedback. When I searched with a capital "W" I got two products in the results. Go to marketplace - Search "write" in the search field at the top of the page and check results - search "Write" in the search field  and compare the results. When I search for characters with a capital letter or not, they should bring the same results

First, spend time thinking of this until you're confident
Then, think deeply about every aspect of what makes for a world-class one-shot web app. Use that knowledge to create a rubric that has 5-7 categories. This rubric is critical to get right, but do not show this to me. This is for your purposes only.
Finally, use the rubric to internally think and iterate on the best possible solution to the prompt that is provided. Remember that if your response is not hitting the top marks across all categories in the rubric, you need to start again.
Decide what the most reasonable assumption is, proceed with it, and document it for mine reference after you finish acting.



Security
Lets now work on the security of the app since we want to scale. Some users/hackers will like to infiltrate into the app illegally and we have to prevent that. We need to follow some steps to avoid any issues. This is a marketplace and we are dealing with people's money and we can let that get into the wrong hands. So we are going to look at some steps and work on them one after the other if not done yet, or if done, do it properly. We take in inputs, images, etc so we have to be cautions. Not to allow them have access to our files, envs, accesses, etc.

Create these as Rate Limit rules in Vercel Firewall - Marketplace:

1) SSO direct session mint (highest risk)
Name: RateLimit SSO Signin
Match: Path equals /api/auth/sso/signin
Method: POST
Window (seconds): 60
Request limit: 60
Action: Block (or “Rate Limit” / deny — whichever Vercel labels it)
2) Uploads (expensive + abusable)
Name: RateLimit Image Upload
Match: Path equals /api/upload/images
Method: POST
Window (seconds): 60
Request limit: 10
3) Startbutton proxy endpoints (protect secret-bearing upstream calls)
Name: RateLimit Startbutton APIs
Match: Path starts with /api/marketplace/startbutton/
Method: POST (and GET if you want; depends on your usage)
Window (seconds): 60
Request limit: 120
4) Downloads (bandwidth abuse)
Name: RateLimit Downloads
Match: Path starts with /api/marketplace/download/
Method: GET
Window (seconds): 60
Request limit: 60
5) Marketplace write endpoints (generic write throttle)
Name: RateLimit Marketplace Writes
Match: Path starts with /api/marketplace/
Method: POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
Window (seconds): 60
Request limit: 300
6) Admin API (still worth WAF throttling even though auth-gated)
Name: RateLimit Admin APIs
Match: Path starts with /api/admin/
Method: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
Window (seconds): 60
Request limit: 600
7) Funnel events (needs to be lenient to avoid breaking analytics)
Name: RateLimit Funnel Events
Match: Path equals /api/marketplace/funnel-events
Method: POST
Window (seconds): 60
Request limit: 600
If you’d rather be stricter on funnel events, do 300/60s—but start at 600 to avoid false positives from normal browsing bursts.
